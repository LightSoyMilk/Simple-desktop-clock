# Simple-desktop-clock
A simple desktop clock that shows the current time with customized background and font colors.
This project was made using Python to constantly update the event loop with the tkinter library for the graphical interface. It was mainly to practice Python over the winter break of 2024 following an online guide by _Madam Carrot_ on Youtube.
